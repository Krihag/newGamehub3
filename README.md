For the cross-course-project we could choose between 3 different briefs. Our task was to first design it and then later code it.

## Description

Gamehub, a fictional online store selling video games, was one of the first real projects we started with at Noroff in our first year. In the first semester we created the website only using HTML and CSS. But we later came back to it in our 2nd semester where we would add Javascript to it and use wordpress as a headless CMS.
